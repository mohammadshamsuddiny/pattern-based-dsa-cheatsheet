# Algorithms & Data Structures – Pattern-Based Cheat Sheet

This repository contains a **comprehensive, pattern-based Algorithms & Data Structures cheat sheet**, designed for:

- Coding interview preparation (FAANG-style)
- Systematic problem-solving
- Long-term reference in a notebook-friendly format

The content is organized **by problem-solving patterns**, not just theoretical definitions.

## 🧠 How This Cheat Sheet Was Generated

This cheat sheet was generated using a **custom, highly-constrained prompt** given to a large language model.

**Key design goals of the prompt:**

- Force complete coverage of all major algorithms and data structures
- Enforce a consistent structure for every pattern
- Organize topics from **easy → hard → interview-ready**
- Focus on **problem-solving intuition**, not memorization
- Produce **Markdown / notebook-ready** output

## 🤖 Model Used

- **Model**: Claude 4.5 Sonnet  
- **Prompting style**: Pattern-based, interview-oriented

If you want to generate the same cheat sheet in another programming language, simply:

1. Reuse the prompt
2. Ask the model to output templates in your preferred language
3. Replace Python-specific implementations as needed
