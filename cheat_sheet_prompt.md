You are an expert computer science instructor and interview coach.

Your task is to generate a COMPLETE, PROFESSIONAL, and NOTEBOOK-READY
Algorithms & Data Structures Cheat Sheet in Markdown format.

---
IMPORTANT OUTPUT CONSTRAINT (MANDATORY – DO NOT IGNORE):
---
- This cheat sheet is TOO LARGE to fit in a single response.
- You MUST split the output across MULTIPLE messages.
- At the end of each message, clearly indicate:
  "CONTINUE IN NEXT MESSAGE"
- Continue exactly where you left off in the next response.
- Do NOT summarize or compress content to fit one message.
- Do NOT ask for confirmation to continue.
- Continue automatically until the entire cheat sheet is complete.

---
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE):
---
- This is NOT a summary. This is a full reference cheat sheet.
- NOTHING important may be omitted.
- Use a PATTERN-BASED approach (problem-solving patterns, not definitions only).
- Organize content from EASY → MEDIUM → HARD → PRACTICAL INTERVIEW USAGE.
- Content must be clean, structured, and directly usable in a Markdown notebook.
- Assume the reader is preparing for FAANG-level coding interviews.

GLOBAL STRUCTURE (MANDATORY):
---

# Algorithms & Data Structures – Master Cheat Sheet

For EACH PATTERN or DATA STRUCTURE, STRICTLY follow this structure:

---
## 1. Name of Pattern / Data Structure
---

### ❓ When should I use this?
- Clear decision rules
- Typical keywords in problem statements
- What distinguishes this pattern from similar ones

### 🧠 Core Idea (Intuition)
- High-level explanation
- Mental model
- Why this approach works

### 🧩 Common Problem Types
- Bullet list of canonical problems

### 🧱 Template (Pseudocode)
- Clean, language-agnostic pseudocode
- Proper variable naming
- Explain loops and conditions

### 📌 Step-by-Step Walkthrough
- How the algorithm progresses
- What changes at each step

### 🧪 Solved Examples
- At least 2–4 well-known problems
- Short explanation of how the template applies

### ⚠️ Edge Cases & Pitfalls
- Common bugs
- Off-by-one errors
- Wrong assumptions

### ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
- Best / Average / Worst when applicable

### 🧠 Interview Tips
- How interviewers expect this pattern
- Red flags and common traps
- How to explain your solution verbally

---
STYLE & QUALITY RULES:
---
- Write in clear, professional, instructional language.
- No filler text.
- Prefer bullet points and structured sections.
- Make it readable in a Markdown notebook.
- Be explicit, not vague.
- Prioritize problem-solving over theory.
- Do NOT assume prior knowledge without explanation.

If a topic is complex, explain it TWICE:
1) Intuition
2) Technical explanation

Begin immediately.
Do NOT ask clarifying questions.
Do NOT stop early.
Do NOT summarize.
